          <q><i>I need people who look at adversity as a challenge and failure as a learning opportunity.</i></q>
          <p> ― John Calipari, Players First: Success from the Inside Out</p> 
            
            
            <p>As a Lexington, KY native, the University of Kentucky holds a special place in my heart (Go Cats!). Maybe that’s why this quote stood out to me so much, or maybe it’s because Cal’s words mirror my own mentality. I’ve always tried to take on challenges and learn from my failures, and I’ve seen how hard work can be the solution to a lot of life’s problems.
            </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I’ve been able to work with some great local companies; actually, my most recent “local” company is a national brand: Valvoline, and I enjoyed spending six years there in Marketing Distribution. Like I said before, I’m always trying to challenge myself, which is why I continued to pursue leadership roles at Valvoline, but even as I worked to move up the ranks, I knew it wasn’t the place I’d spend the rest of my days. I had dreams of something bigger, and I knew that meant stepping out of my comfort zone.
        </p>
    <p>
            Now, we all know it’s easier to take a leap when you’ve got a good reason, and for me, that driving force has always been my wife and our plans for a family. I couldn’t have made the moves I did without Amy’s support. After talking with her about what could be next, I decided to dive into a field I had been interested in but knew little about, Web Development. When I took an introductory course, I knew it could be a career that would excite me and challenge me creatively. Now time has flown by as I wrap up my schooling in Awesome Inc’s Web Development Bootcamp, I’m ready to put my skills to the test.
        </p>  
    <p>
            Along the way I’ve enjoyed learning each new language, framework, and library using the Agile method. As I continue my search for Junior Developer positions, I plan to continue learning so I can become a more equipped programmer, and I hope to gain certification as a SCRUM Master. My sights, as always are set on taking my development career to distinguished heights. If you’re an employer looking for someone who works hard on and off the clock, is a friend to many, and easy to work with, you can stop the search here. Hi, I’m Tim.</p>
